# Getting Started
This project works in tandem with the [llm_visualization repo](https://github.com/zgordon01/llm_visualization). First get that running, then proceed!

1. Run `npm install`
<br /><br />
2. Create `.env` in the root of the project (same level as package.json) and add values to it.<br />
`REACT_APP_POST_ENDPOINT` is the POST endpoint from the llm_visualization api
```
REACT_APP_POST_ENDPOINT=localhost:8000/
```
 test commit
3. `npm run start`
